Prompt 1: 

I need to implement a requirement based on User Stories for a Recipe Management app. The user story is: As a user, I want to search for recipes by name or ingredient so I can quickly find what I need. First, create a search input and button that allows users to search recipes by name or ingredient. Also, display the filtered results below the search bar.

Prompt 2:

Now, i need to implement the search function. That is, a function that takes an array of recipe objects and a search term, and returns recipes where the name or ingredient includes the search term.

Prompt 3:

The user needs to be able to undo the search. Add a reset button that clears the search input and shows all recipes again. Display a message: "Search reset. Showing all recipes."

Prompt 4:

After a search or undo action, show a temporary confirmation message below the search bar.

Prompt 5:

We need to ensure that all data must be saved correctly and remain accessible afterward. Thus, store the list of recipes in localStorage and load it when the page reloads.

You have to be very specific with the steps and the functions you need, or it will do extra things you haven't asked for
