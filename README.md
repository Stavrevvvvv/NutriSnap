Prompt 1: 

I need to implement a requirement based on User Stories for a Recipe Management app. The user story is: As a user, I want to search for recipes by name or ingredient so I can quickly find what I need. First, create a search input and button that allows users to search recipes by name or ingredient. Also, display the filtered results below the search bar.

Prompt 2:

Now, i need to implement the search function. That is, a function that takes an array of recipe objects and a search term, and returns recipes where the name or ingredient includes the search term.

Prompt 3:

The user needs to be able to undo the search. Add a reset button that clears the search input and shows all recipes again. Display a message: "Search reset. Showing all recipes."

Prompt 4:

After a search or undo action, show a temporary confirmation message below the search bar.

Prompt 5:

We need to ensure that all data must be saved correctly and remain accessible afterward. Thus, store the list of recipes in localStorage and load it when the page reloads.

# Lessons Learned:

You have to be very specific with the steps and the functions you need, or it will do extra things you haven't asked for
